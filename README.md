### **Q1: Feature Implementation in CalculatorPlus App**

#### 🔨 Steps Followed:

1. **Created Repository**: `git_assignment_HeroVired`
2. **Branch Created**: `dev`
3. **Initial Code Added**:
    - Basic arithmetic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide
4. **Tested Code**: All basic arithmatic functions were tested
5. **Merged to Master**: `dev` branch merged to `main`
6. **Created Release**: Tagged as `v1.0`
7. **Collaborator Added**: A classmate added to collaborate on GitHub


#### 🔁 Further Feature Sqrt Workflow

9. **New Branch**: `feature/sqrt` created from `dev`
10. **Square Root Logic Added**
11. **Bug Reported**: In `divide()` method
12. **Fix Applied in `dev`**: 
```python
def divide(self, a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b

```
13.  **Pull Request Raised**: `feature/sqrt` ➝ `main`
